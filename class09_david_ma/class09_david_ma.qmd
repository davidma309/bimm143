# Section 1: Intro to RPDB

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray and electron microscopy?

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv", row.names = 1)

numerics <- function(x){
  
  #Takes the sum after removing commas and converting strings into integers
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}

```

For Xray:
```{r}
numerics(db$X.ray) / numerics(db$Total)
```

For EM:
```{r}
numerics(db$EM) / numerics(db$Total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
numerics(db[1, "Total"]) / numerics(db$Total)
```

# Section 2: Visualizing HIV-1

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

![HIV-PR structure from MERK with a bound drug](1HSG.png)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH 308

# Section 3: Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are in this PDB object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two-non protein residues?

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)
```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in M0lstar.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
